From their website, the CPF only has two classes of lifters:
 - Raw (no wraps)
 - Multi-ply

Except that sometimes they have "Classic Raw" divisions. So who knows?
They also sometimes call Wraps "Assisted Raw".

Note that if a division is labeled "RA-O", that means the "Amateur" division,
not "Raw Assisted" or something like that.
