From their website, the CPF only has two classes of lifters:
 - Raw (no wraps)
 - Multi-ply
 - This is lies: they actually have wraps now, and they don't mark it.

Except that sometimes they have "Classic Raw" divisions. So who knows?
They also sometimes call Wraps "Assisted Raw".

Note that "RA" doesn't mean "Raw Assisted" but "Raw Amateur" or something like that.
