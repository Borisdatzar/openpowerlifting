# Brand Guidelines

This document describes general guidelines for how to communicate when representing the OpenPowerlifting project in a formal capacity. It is intended primarily for use by staff on social media when posting as the project.

These guidelines are not intended to be prescriptive. Rather, they are intended to showcase the "sprit" of the project.

## How OpenPowerlifting Sees Itself

### What the OpenPowerlifting Project Is

OpenPowerlifting is a project to archive powerlifting history and make that information useful as a service to the powerlifting community. The main output of the project is *the database itself*, not just the showcase website.

Basically: *we are the historians/record-keepers for all of powerlifting*.

"All of powerlifting" is taken very literally: *we remember lifters at every level of the sport, not just the elites*!

What sets the OpenPowerlifting project apart from other record-keepers is *the completeness of the data* and that *we do not attempt to control access to the data*.

In terms of completeness:

  1. All federations may have their data catalogued, regardless of size or fame.
  2. We do not alter the data from the federations in any way: we merely report their results. We do not pass judgment on federations' calls.
  3. All of our data is constantly run through an extensive error-checking test suite. We have *extremely high data quality*.
  4. We go out of our way to find old meet results that have been otherwise lost.

In terms of not controlling access to the data:

  1. Our database is made easily-downloadable in convenient formats, and people are actively encouraged to download it.
  2. All of our data is released into the public domain, so anyone can use it for any purpose.
  3. All of our code is released under Free Software licenses.
  4. No one is ever required to pay for access.
  5. The entire project is available on GitHub, and we actively solicit community contributions.

In addition, the project is *entirely funded by the powerlifting community*:

  1. The website has no ads.
  2. The project is 100% funded through voluntary contributions to our Patreon account.
  3. *We never mention that there is a Patreon account, and we absolutely never ask anyone to donate!*

### What OpenPowerlifting.org Is

[OpenPowerlifting.org](http://www.openpowerlifting.org) organizes and presents the database to lifters in a way that is useful and informative.

We don't impose viewpoints on users. Instead, they are given controls and encouraged to look at the data however they choose. For example, while PowerliftingWatch at one point made the controversial call to remove SPF lifters from their All-Time rankings, we would never do that. Instead, we might give lifters an option so that *they* can filter out a federation from the rankings. The choice is up to each lifter.

We don't try to keep users on the site as long as possible. Instead, we try to make it efficient for lifters to find the information they were looking for, or to just explore. We don't use attention-grabbing techniques, and we realize that it's perfectly normal for someone to not visit the website more than once a month. We're not going to become a social network.

Because we don't care about keeping users on the site as long as possible, we are free to link to other Web properties, such as Instagram, federations, and even competing sites. We collect all of the information from the powerlifting community and organize it to make it convenient.

Basically: we don't care how often people visit the website, but when someone wants to look up powerlifting information, we want them to think of OpenPowerlifting. We accomplish that through data quality and reputation over a long term.
